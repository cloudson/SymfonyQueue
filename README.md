Symfony Queue
========= 

A library to decorate the symfony Event dispatcher and make it works with any queue manager.  

:exclamation: For while, this library is under development, it's an insane idea and just for science! 

# Motivation 

Symfony was born using event oriented programming, and many times we want to 
use a listener to enqueue a job in a queue manager (eg:. rabbitmq, activemq, amazon sqs...). 

So, why the listener is not the consumer itself, and a event dispatch doest not create a job in
that queue? 

# How to use 

Soon...
